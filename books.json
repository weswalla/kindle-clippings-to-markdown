The victories of capitalism are examined in the following chapter. This chapter is dedicated to the love story between European imperialism and modern science. The Mentality of Conquest Modern science flourished in and thanks to European empires. The discipline obviously owes a huge debt to ancient scientific traditions, such as those of classical Greece, China, India and Islam, yet its unique character began to take shape only in the early modern period, hand in hand with the imperial expansion of Spain, Portugal, Britain, France, Russia and the Netherlands. During the early modern period, Chinese, Indians, Muslims, Native Americans and Polynesians continued to make important contributions to the Scientific Revolution. The insights of Muslim economists were studied by Adam Smith and Karl Marx, treatments pioneered by Native American doctors found their way into English medical texts and data extracted from Polynesian informants revolutionised Western anthropology. But until the mid-twentieth century, the people who collated these myriad scientific discoveries, creating scientific disciplines in the process, were the ruling and intellectual elites of the global European empires. The Far East and the Islamic world produced minds as intelligent and curious as those of Europe. However, between 1500 and 1950 they did not produce anything that comes even close to Newtonian physics or Darwinian biology. This does not mean that Europeans have a unique gene for science, or that they will forever dominate the study of physics and biology.

They seem to forget that the process of writing starts much, much earlier than that blank screen and that the actual writing down of the argument is the smallest part of its development. This book aims to fill this gap by showing you how to efficiently turn your thoughts and discoveries into convincing written pieces and build up a treasure of smart and interconnected notes along the way. You can use this pool of notes not only to make writing easier and more fun for yourself, but also to learn for the long run and generate new ideas. But most of all, you can write every day in a way that brings your projects forward.","page":null,"time":"Saturday, September 12, 2020 8:18:13 AM"},"58":{"content":"Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work. And maybe that is the reason why we rarely think about this writing, the everyday writing, the note-taking and draft-making. Like breathing, it is vital to what we do, but because we do it constantly, it escapes our attention. But while even the best breathing technique would probably not make much of a difference to our writing, any improvement in the way we organise the everyday writing, how we take notes of what we encounter and what we do with them, will make all the difference for the moment we do face the blank page/screen – or rather not, as those who take smart notes will never have the problem of a blank screen again.","page":null,"time":"Saturday, September 12, 2020 9:17:06 AM"},"64":{"content":"We don’t experience any immediate negative feedback if we do it badly. But without an immediate experience of failure, there is also not much demand for help. And the publishing market working how it works, there is not much help in supply for this lack of demand either.

In fact, there is no measurable correlation between a high IQ and academic success – at least not north of 120. Yes, a certain intellectual capacity helps to get into academia, and if you struggle severely with an IQ test, it is likely that you will struggle to solve academic problems, too. But once you are in, a superior IQ will neither help you to distinguish yourself nor protect you from failure. What does make a significant difference along the whole intelligence spectrum is something else: how much self-discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand (Duckworth and Seligman, 2005; Tangney, Baumeister, and Boone, 2004).","page":null,"time":"Saturday, September 12, 2020 11:06:27 AM"},"98":{"content":"Luckily, this is not the whole story.

They investigate how the experience of scarcity has cognitive effects and causes changes in decision- making processes. They help the reader understand why people with almost no time or money sometimes do things that don’t seem to make any sense to outside observers. People facing deadlines sometimes switch frantically between all kinds of tasks. People with little money sometimes spend it on seeming luxuries like take-away food. From the outside, it would make more sense to do one thing at a time, or buy food in bulk and cook for yourself. The book is interesting, because the authors don’t question this behavior rhetorically or even in a judgemental way, but investigate it as a universal human phenomenon. I took some literature notes collecting reasons how and why humans act so very differently when they experience scarcity. This was step one, done with an eye towards the argument of the book. I had questions in mind like: Is this convincing? What methods do they use? Which of the references are familiar? But the first question I asked myself when it came to writing the first permanent note for the slip-box was: What does this all mean for my own research and the questions I think about in my slip-box? This is just another way of asking: Why did the aspects I wrote down catch my interest? If I were a psychologist, this book would interest me for completely different reasons than if I were a politician or a debt adviser, or if I had bought it out of personal interest. As someone with a sociological perspective on political questions and an interest in the project of a theory of society, my first note reads plainly: “Any comprehensive analysis of social inequality must include the cognitive effects of scarcity. Cf. Mullainathan and Shafir 2013.” This immediately triggers further questions, which I can discuss on following notes, starting with: “Why?”","page":null,"time":"Friday, November 20, 2020 11:03:37 PM"},"1440":{"content":"Now, I already have two notes in my slip-box, based on the literature notes I took while reading the book, but written along the lines of my own thinking. One note states the relevance of the book for my own thinking and one explains my idea in more detail. Here I could draw from my literature notes as a source of valuable facts and insight. Even though the answers to the question of why scarcity is relevant to the study of social inequality are all in the book, they are not just there to be copied. They need to be made explicit. That means to think about how the insight into cognitive effects of scarcity affects the analysis of social inequality. While I am writing these notes, it becomes obvious that the answer to the question “why” has already triggered more follow-up questions, like: Isn’t this already discussed in theories of social inequality? If yes: Who discussed it? If not: Why not? And where do I turn to, to find answers to these questions? Correct: The first choice for further inquiry is the slip-box.

None of it needs to be discussed right away, especially as most of these ideas would require more research and reading. But there is also no reason not to write down these possible connections and come back to them later, if my research points me back to them.

In simpler terms, VO2 max is basically a measure of how much oxygen you can take in and effectively use. The normal score for test subjects is 40 milliliters per kilogram per minute. I came out with 66—way up in the 98th or 99th percentile. The other measure they tested me for was anaerobic threshold.

Ambition and desire overpowering common sense have killed many a Himalayan climber. Our instincts have evolved over millions of years, instincts that kept our remote ancestors alive. Humans with poor survival instincts got weeded out long ago, through natural selection. The fight-or-flight instinct is a perfect example, passed down to us in our very genes. I’ve learned that I need to listen to my instincts. The signals we receive from them are not imaginary. On K2 in 1992, I committed a nearly fatal error when I failed to acknowledge those signals and kept pushing on toward the summit. Yet even at the time, I knew I was making a mistake.

Orders such as these were notionally issued on the authority of public legislation; however, their contents, even their existence, were classified Top Secret. According to Section 215 of the Patriot Act, aka the “business records” provision, the government was authorized to obtain orders from the FISA Court that compelled third parties to produce “any tangible thing” that was “relevant” to foreign intelligence or terrorism investigations. But as the court order I found made clear, the NSA had secretly interpreted this authorization as a license to collect all of the “business records,” or metadata, of telephone communications coming through American telecoms, such as Verizon and AT&T, on “an ongoing daily basis.” This included, of course, records of telephone communications between American citizens, the practice of which was unconstitutional.","page":"198","time":"Sunday, July 25, 2021 9:12:21 PM"},"3038":{"content":"Additionally, Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act allows the IC to target any foreigner outside the United States deemed likely to communicate “foreign intelligence information”—a broad category of potential targets that includes journalists, corporate employees, academics, aid workers, and countless others innocent of any wrongdoing whatsoever.

You open a Web browser, type in a URL, and hit Enter. The URL is, in effect, a request, and this request goes out in search of its destination server. Somewhere in the midst of its travels, however, before your request gets to that server, it will have to pass through TURBULENCE, one of the NSA’s most powerful weapons. Specifically, your request passes through a few black servers stacked on top of one another, together about the size of a four-shelf bookcase. These are installed in special rooms at major private telecommunications buildings throughout allied countries, as well as in US embassies and on US military bases, and contain two critical tools. The first, TURMOIL, handles “passive collection,” making a copy of the data coming through. The second, TURBINE, is in charge of “active collection”—that is, actively tampering with the users. You can think of TURMOIL as a guard positioned at an invisible firewall through which Internet traffic must pass. Seeing your request, it checks its metadata for selectors, or criteria, that mark it as deserving of more scrutiny. Those selectors can be whatever the NSA chooses, whatever the NSA finds suspicious: a particular email address, credit card, or phone number; the geographic origin or destination of your Internet activity; or just certain keywords such as “anonymous Internet proxy” or “protest.” If TURMOIL flags your traffic as suspicious, it tips it over to TURBINE, which diverts your request to the NSA’s servers. There, algorithms decide which of the agency’s exploits—malware programs—to use against you. This choice is based on the type of website you’re trying to visit as much as on your computer’s software and Internet connection. These chosen exploits are sent back to TURBINE (by programs of the QUANTUM suite, if you’re wondering), which injects them into the traffic channel and delivers them to you along with whatever website you requested. The end result: you get all the content you want, along with all the surveillance you don’t, and it all happens in less than 686 milliseconds. Completely unbeknownst to you. Once the exploits are on your computer, the NSA can access not just your metadata, but your data as well. Your entire digital life now belongs to them.","page":"200","time":"Monday, July 26, 2021 6:37:06 PM"},"3095":{"content":"I liked reading the Constitution partially because its ideas are great, partially because its prose is good, but really because it freaked out my coworkers.

After 9/11, the court expanded its role from authorizing the surveillance of specific individuals to ruling on the legality and constitutionality of broad programmatic surveillance, without any adversarial scrutiny. A body that previously had been tasked with approving the surveillance of Foreign Terrorist #1 or Foreign Spy #2 was now being used to legitimize the whole combined infrastructure of PRISM and upstream collection.

Moreover, the ACLU could not use the litigation to seek evidence of surveillance, because the existence (or nonexistence) of that evidence was “a state secret,” and leaks to journalists didn’t count. In other words, the court couldn’t recognize the information that was publicly known from having been published in the media; it could only recognize the information that the government officially confirmed as being publicly known.

In this part of the book, we look at the opposite notion; the extent to which computation itself occurs in nature. In what sense do natural systems “compute”? At a very general level, one might say that computation is what a complex system does with information in order to succeed or adapt in its environment. But can we make this statement more precise? Where is the information, and what exactly does the complex system do with it?","page":"158","time":"Monday, January 17, 2022 9:40:33 PM"},"2800":{"content":"All this is relatively recent work and needs to be developed much further. I believe that this approach to understanding computation, albeit unconventional, will turn out to be useful in other contexts in which computation is distributed among simple components with no central control. For example, it is still a mystery how high-level information about sensory data is encoded and processed in the brain. Perhaps the explanation will turn out to be something close to particle-like or, given the brain’s three dimensions, wave-like computation, where neurons are the scaffolding for information-carrying waves of activity and their information-processing interactions.","page":"183","time":"Tuesday, January 18, 2022 9:04:06 AM"},"2806":{"content":"Every leafy plant’s leaves are covered with stomata—small apertures that open or close in response to light and humidity. When open, the stomata let in carbon dioxide, which is used in photosynthesis. However, open stomata cause water to evaporate from the plant’s fluid stores. Botanist Keith Mott, physicist David Peak, and their colleagues at Utah State University have long been observing the patterns of opening and closing of stomata on leaves, and believe that the stomata constitute a network that is something like a two-dimensional cellular automaton. They also observe that the temporal patterns of opening and closing on the leaves looks very much like two-dimensional versions of interacting particles. They hypothesize that plants perform a distributed, decentralized computation via their stomata—namely, how to optimally open and close stomata in order to best balance carbon dioxide gain and water loss—and that the computation may be explainable in terms of such particles.","page":"183","time":"Tuesday, January 18, 2022 9:13:29 AM"},"2833":{"content":"we need to answer the following: What plays the role of “information” in this system?

In essence, such a description would provide a “high-level language” for biology.","page":"188","time":"Tuesday, January 18, 2022 10:29:15 PM"},"3015":{"content":"As was the case for cellular automata, when I talk about information processing in these systems I am referring not to the actions of individual components such as cells, ants, or enzymes, but to the collective actions of large groups of these components.

This is an example of needing to keep a balance between exploration and exploitation, which I mentioned in chapter 12. When promising possibilities are identified, they should be exploited at a rate and intensity related to their estimated promise, which is being continually updated. But at all times exploration for new possibilities should continue. The problem is how to allocate limited resources—be they ants, lymphocytes, enzymes, or thoughts—to different possibilities in a dynamic way that takes new information into account as it is obtained. Ant colonies have solved this problem by having large numbers of ants follow a combination of two strategies: continual random foraging combined with a simple feedback mechanism of preferentially following trails scented with pheromones and laying down additional pheromone while doing so.","page":"216","time":"Monday, January 24, 2022 10:56:34 PM"},"3305":{"content":"The immune system also seems to maintain a near optimal balance between exploration and exploitation. We saw in chapter 12 how the immune system uses randomness to attain the potential for responding to virtually any pathogen it encounters. This potential is realized when an antigen activates a particular B cell and triggers the proliferation of that cell and the production of antibodies with increasing specificity for the antigen in question. Thus the immune system exploits the information it encounters in the form of antigens by allocating much of its resources toward targeting those antigens that are actually found to be present. But it always continues to explore additional possibilities that it might encounter by maintaining its huge repertoire of different B cells. Like ant colonies, the immune system combines randomness with highly directed behavior based on feedback.","page":"216","time":"Monday, January 24, 2022 10:58:55 PM"}},"notes":{"863":{"content":"Its like a recognition of the coupled entglemnt of te mind and physcal systems.
