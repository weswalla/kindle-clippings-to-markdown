The Mentality of Conquest Modern science flourished in and thanks to European empires. The discipline obviously owes a huge debt to ancient scientific traditions, such as those of classical Greece, China, India and Islam, yet its unique character began to take shape only in the early modern period, hand in hand with the imperial expansion of Spain, Portugal, Britain, France, Russia and the Netherlands. During the early modern period, Chinese, Indians, Muslims, Native Americans and Polynesians continued to make important contributions to the Scientific Revolution. The insights of Muslim economists were studied by Adam Smith and Karl Marx, treatments pioneered by Native American doctors found their way into English medical texts and data extracted from Polynesian informants revolutionised Western anthropology. But until the mid-twentieth century, the people who collated these myriad scientific discoveries, creating scientific disciplines in the process, were the ruling and intellectual elites of the global European empires. The Far East and the Islamic world produced minds as intelligent and curious as those of Europe. However, between 1500 and 1950 they did not produce anything that comes even close to Newtonian physics or Darwinian biology. This does not mean that Europeans have a unique gene for science, or that they will forever dominate the study of physics and biology.

They seem to forget that the process of writing starts much, much earlier than that blank screen and that the actual writing down of the argument is the smallest part of its development. This book aims to fill this gap by showing you how to efficiently turn your thoughts and discoveries into convincing written pieces and build up a treasure of smart and interconnected notes along the way. You can use this pool of notes not only to make writing easier and more fun for yourself, but also to learn for the long run and generate new ideas. But most of all, you can write every day in a way that brings your projects forward.","page":null,"time":"Saturday, September 12, 2020 8:18:13 AM"},"58":{"content":"Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work. And maybe that is the reason why we rarely think about this writing, the everyday writing, the note-taking and draft-making. Like breathing, it is vital to what we do, but because we do it constantly, it escapes our attention. But while even the best breathing technique would probably not make much of a difference to our writing, any improvement in the way we organise the everyday writing, how we take notes of what we encounter and what we do with them, will make all the difference for the moment we do face the blank page/screen – or rather not, as those who take smart notes will never have the problem of a blank screen again.","page":null,"time":"Saturday, September 12, 2020 9:17:06 AM"},"64":{"content":"We don’t experience any immediate negative feedback if we do it badly. But without an immediate experience of failure, there is also not much demand for help.

In fact, there is no measurable correlation between a high IQ and academic success – at least not north of 120. Yes, a certain intellectual capacity helps to get into academia, and if you struggle severely with an IQ test, it is likely that you will struggle to solve academic problems, too. But once you are in, a superior IQ will neither help you to distinguish yourself nor protect you from failure. What does make a significant difference along the whole intelligence spectrum is something else: how much self-discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand (Duckworth and Seligman, 2005; Tangney, Baumeister, and Boone, 2004).","page":null,"time":"Saturday, September 12, 2020 11:06:27 AM"},"98":{"content":"Luckily, this is not the whole story.

For example, I recently read the book “Scarcity: Why Having Too Little Means So Much” (2013) by Mullainathan and Shafir. They investigate how the experience of scarcity has cognitive effects and causes changes in decision- making processes. They help the reader understand why people with almost no time or money sometimes do things that don’t seem to make any sense to outside observers. People facing deadlines sometimes switch frantically between all kinds of tasks. People with little money sometimes spend it on seeming luxuries like take-away food. From the outside, it would make more sense to do one thing at a time, or buy food in bulk and cook for yourself. The book is interesting, because the authors don’t question this behavior rhetorically or even in a judgemental way, but investigate it as a universal human phenomenon. I took some literature notes collecting reasons how and why humans act so very differently when they experience scarcity. This was step one, done with an eye towards the argument of the book. I had questions in mind like: Is this convincing? What methods do they use? Which of the references are familiar? But the first question I asked myself when it came to writing the first permanent note for the slip-box was: What does this all mean for my own research and the questions I think about in my slip-box? This is just another way of asking: Why did the aspects I wrote down catch my interest? If I were a psychologist, this book would interest me for completely different reasons than if I were a politician or a debt adviser, or if I had bought it out of personal interest. As someone with a sociological perspective on political questions and an interest in the project of a theory of society, my first note reads plainly: “Any comprehensive analysis of social inequality must include the cognitive effects of scarcity.

Even though the answers to the question of why scarcity is relevant to the study of social inequality are all in the book, they are not just there to be copied. They need to be made explicit. That means to think about how the insight into cognitive effects of scarcity affects the analysis of social inequality. While I am writing these notes, it becomes obvious that the answer to the question “why” has already triggered more follow-up questions, like: Isn’t this already discussed in theories of social inequality? If yes: Who discussed it? If not: Why not? And where do I turn to, to find answers to these questions? Correct: The first choice for further inquiry is the slip-box.

None of it needs to be discussed right away, especially as most of these ideas would require more research and reading. But there is also no reason not to write down these possible connections and come back to them later, if my research points me back to them. The more notes the slip-box contains, the more interesting and prolific this step will become and the more research questions will be triggered. Just by writing down these questions and making possible connections explicit in writing are the concepts and theories being investigated.

Gwern Branwen's article on spaced repetition is a good popular overview. You’ll forget that knowledge more slowly. With a few retrievals strategically spaced over time, you can effectively halt forgetting.

The old leather boots that climbers favored for more than a century are vastly inferior to plastic, because leather absorbs moisture, which then freezes. It’s a natural recipe for frostbite. Lachenal and Herzog lost their toes to frostbite on Annapurna in 1950 because they were wearing leather boots.

Synthetic fabric is preferable to wool—wool tends to be itchy. You don’t want cotton, because it soaks up your sweat and does not retain heat as well as wet synthetics do. Over the long johns, a one-piece sleeveless fleece suit. You don’t want an upper fleece vest that you have to tuck into fleece pants; with a harness and a waist belt from your pack girdling your midsection, there’s already too much going on.","page":"133","time":"Friday, February 19, 2021 7:55:03 PM"},"2034":{"content":"Protecting your hands is absolutely critical.

If it’s not too cold, I can get away with sunglasses, but in extreme weather I need super-dark wraparound ski-type goggles.

Probably the best indicator of one’s ability to perform in thin air is called VO2 max. It’s a ratio of milliliters of oxygen inhaled to body weight in kilograms, per minute. In simpler terms, VO2 max is basically a measure of how much oxygen you can take in and effectively use. The normal score for test subjects is 40 milliliters per kilogram per minute. I came out with 66—way up in the 98th or 99th percentile. The other measure they tested me for was anaerobic threshold. This indicates at what percentage of VO2 max you start functioning in an anaerobic (that is, an oxygenless) state. Average is 55 percent; I tested at 88 percent. In a nutshell, this meant that at a point when normal folks are bonking from lack of oxygen, I can still cruise along. These two parameters are especially interesting because they’re not completely subject to training. Where you’ll top out with VO2 max and anaerobic threshold is limited by your own physiology.

You open a Web browser, type in a URL, and hit Enter. The URL is, in effect, a request, and this request goes out in search of its destination server. Somewhere in the midst of its travels, however, before your request gets to that server, it will have to pass through TURBULENCE, one of the NSA’s most powerful weapons. Specifically, your request passes through a few black servers stacked on top of one another, together about the size of a four-shelf bookcase. These are installed in special rooms at major private telecommunications buildings throughout allied countries, as well as in US embassies and on US military bases, and contain two critical tools. The first, TURMOIL, handles “passive collection,” making a copy of the data coming through. The second, TURBINE, is in charge of “active collection”—that is, actively tampering with the users. You can think of TURMOIL as a guard positioned at an invisible firewall through which Internet traffic must pass. Seeing your request, it checks its metadata for selectors, or criteria, that mark it as deserving of more scrutiny. Those selectors can be whatever the NSA chooses, whatever the NSA finds suspicious: a particular email address, credit card, or phone number; the geographic origin or destination of your Internet activity; or just certain keywords such as “anonymous Internet proxy” or “protest.” If TURMOIL flags your traffic as suspicious, it tips it over to TURBINE, which diverts your request to the NSA’s servers. There, algorithms decide which of the agency’s exploits—malware programs—to use against you. This choice is based on the type of website you’re trying to visit as much as on your computer’s software and Internet connection. These chosen exploits are sent back to TURBINE (by programs of the QUANTUM suite, if you’re wondering), which injects them into the traffic channel and delivers them to you along with whatever website you requested. The end result: you get all the content you want, along with all the surveillance you don’t, and it all happens in less than 686 milliseconds. Completely unbeknownst to you. Once the exploits are on your computer, the NSA can access not just your metadata, but your data as well.

Botanist Keith Mott, physicist David Peak, and their colleagues at Utah State University have long been observing the patterns of opening and closing of stomata on leaves, and believe that the stomata constitute a network that is something like a two-dimensional cellular automaton. They also observe that the temporal patterns of opening and closing on the leaves looks very much like two-dimensional versions of interacting particles. They hypothesize that plants perform a distributed, decentralized computation via their stomata—namely, how to optimally open and close stomata in order to best balance carbon dioxide gain and water loss—and that the computation may be explainable in terms of such particles.","page":"183","time":"Tuesday, January 18, 2022 9:13:29 AM"},"2833":{"content":"we need to answer the following: What plays the role of “information” in this system?

This is an example of needing to keep a balance between exploration and exploitation, which I mentioned in chapter 12. When promising possibilities are identified, they should be exploited at a rate and intensity related to their estimated promise, which is being continually updated. But at all times exploration for new possibilities should continue. The problem is how to allocate limited resources—be they ants, lymphocytes, enzymes, or thoughts—to different possibilities in a dynamic way that takes new information into account as it is obtained. Ant colonies have solved this problem by having large numbers of ants follow a combination of two strategies: continual random foraging combined with a simple feedback mechanism of preferentially following trails scented with pheromones and laying down additional pheromone while doing so.","page":"216","time":"Monday, January 24, 2022 10:56:34 PM"},"3305":{"content":"The immune system also seems to maintain a near optimal balance between exploration and exploitation. We saw in chapter 12 how the immune system uses randomness to attain the potential for responding to virtually any pathogen it encounters. This potential is realized when an antigen activates a particular B cell and triggers the proliferation of that cell and the production of antibodies with increasing specificity for the antigen in question. Thus the immune system exploits the information it encounters in the form of antigens by allocating much of its resources toward targeting those antigens that are actually found to be present. But it always continues to explore additional possibilities that it might encounter by maintaining its huge repertoire of different B cells. Like ant colonies, the immune system combines randomness with highly directed behavior based on feedback.","page":"216","time":"Monday, January 24, 2022 10:58:55 PM"}},"notes":{"863":{"content":"Its like a recognition of the coupled entglemnt of te mind and physcal systems.
